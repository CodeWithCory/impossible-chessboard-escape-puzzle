# almost-impossible-chess-problem
Solution implementation to the Almost Impossible Chess Problem. Prompt: Prisoner 1 walks in to a room, sees a chessboard where each square has a coin on top, flipped either to heads or tails. The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees. Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin. Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins. The Prisoners can coordinate a plan ahead of time. What's the plan?
